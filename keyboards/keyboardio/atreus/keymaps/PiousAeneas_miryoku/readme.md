# PiousAeneas Custom Miryoku

![Custom Keymap](layout/keyboard-layout-PiousAeneas-miryoku.png)

A custom keyboard layout adapted heavily from Manna Harbour's [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) layout. Compile firmware by typing: `qmk compile -kb keyboardio/atreus -km PiousAeneas_miryoku`.

## Changes vs. Standard Miryoku

1. Caps: Added Caps Lock on Mouse layer, removed Caps Lock on Shifted Caps Word because of issues with the key override feature.
2. Turned on Permissive Hold with the exception of ring and pinky finger home-row mods.
