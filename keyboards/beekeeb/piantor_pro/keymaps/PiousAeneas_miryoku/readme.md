Derived from [Keyboardio Atreus](../../../../keyboardio/atreus/keymaps/PiousAeneas_miryoku) by changing only the bottom "Keymap Definitions" section by e.g. adding outside columns, removing extra keys on bottom row and inner row, and replacing `LAYOUT` with `LAYOUT_split_3x6_3`). See source keymap for documentation.
