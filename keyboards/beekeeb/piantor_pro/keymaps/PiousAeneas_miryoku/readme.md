Derived from [Keyboardio Atreus](../../../../keyboardio/atreus/keymaps/PiousAeneas_miryoku) by changing only keymap itself (add outside columns, remove extra keys on bottom row and inner row, replace `LAYOUT` with `LAYOUT_split_3x6_3`). See source keymap for documentation.

Compile a firmware with your new keymap by typing: `qmk compile -kb beekeeb/piantor_pro -km PiousAeneas_miryoku`.
